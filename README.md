# GraphQL: Students and Instructors

_by Nicholas Neumann-Chun_

This is really all about GraphQL, and hence the schema defined in `data/schema.js`.  To run it,

- do `npm run setup`
- then `babel-node --presets es2015 app.js`
- finally, go to `http://localhost:3000/graphql`

This will allow you to use GraphQL to query a simple dataset consisting of students, instructors, courses, and grades.
