# GraphQL: Students and Instructors

_by Nicholas Neumann-Chun_

This is really all about GraphQL, and hence the schema defined in `data/schema.js`.  The rest is background clutter copied from https://github.com/reactjscamp/bookmarks.  To run it, first do `npm install`, then `babel-node --presets es2015 ./bin/www`.  Finally, go to `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

This will allow you to use GraphQL to query a simple dataset consisting of students, instructors, courses, and grades.
